# steganography

Allows low-quality images to be hidden within higher-quality images. The least significant bits of image are changed to the most significant bits of hidden images. Can be tweaked to allow for higher-quality images to be hidden, at the cost of the quality of the image mask, which may make it obvious that an image is being encoded in the image mask.

A project for a Computer Science class.
